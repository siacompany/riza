# riza project

i was getting a hang on CSS and responsive CSS
didnt know a thing about what backend was :D
in that time i just found out abous something called BOOTSTRAP and i was pretty excited
tried to achive a minimal UI 
as you can see i'm not good at UI



key elements of this project :

- responsive 
- simple
- make people laugh
